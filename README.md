# Unreal Engine Assignment: Minigame for a Local Multiplayer Party Game

## Premise
In this assignment, students will develop a local multiplayer party game using Unreal Engine 5. The core gameplay revolves around competitive 1v1 minigames that are part of a 4-player local multiplayer experience. Each student will be responsible for creating a unique minigame that contributes to the overall party game. The project will focus on leveraging Unreal Engine's tools to build a fully functional and polished minigame, emphasizing gameplay mechanics, visual and audio integration, and seamless player interaction.

## Core Gameplay Loop
The game is structured around a series of competitive 1v1 minigames. Players will participate in these minigames sequentially, and the player with the most victories at the end of all minigames will be declared the overall winner. The game supports local multiplayer with up to four players, each using a gamepad to control their character.

## Assignment Objectives
Students will be expected to achieve the following objectives by the end of the assignment:

### 1. Create a Functional Minigame Prototype
- Develop a working prototype of a 1v1 minigame that supports local multiplayer with 4 players.
- The minigame must be either splitscreen or shared screen.

### 2. Implement Core Unreal Engine Features
- Utilize Unreal Engine 5's tools and editors to design and implement key aspects of the minigame, such as gameplay mechanics, animation, visual effects, and sound design.
- Students are required to work within the provided low-poly stylized asset pack (including characters) to maintain visual consistency.

### 3. Integrate and Test the Minigame
- Ensure that the minigame runs smoothly, without significant bugs, and provides a fun and engaging experience for players.
- Playtesting should be conducted using Unreal Engine’s debugging tools, including the Blueprint Debugger, breakpoints, and print strings.

## Grading Criteria

### Godkänt (Pass)
- **Functional Game Prototype**:
  - The student must develop a working prototype of their minigame where 4 players can play from start to finish.
- **Basic Integration**:
  - The minigame must be functional and smoothly playable, though minor bugs are acceptable.
- **Use of Core Framework classes**:
  - Demonstrate the use of relevant framework classes tied to the engine and to the party game project (game mode, player controller etc) to create the minigame and successfully integrate it into the larger game.

### Väl Godkänt (Distinction)
- **Flawless Minigame**:
  - The minigame must be bug-free and provide a smooth, polished gameplay experience.
- **Advanced Feature Implementation**:
  - Implement additional features in at least three specialization tracks, such as:
    - **Sequencer**: Create an introductory cinematic sequence.
    - **VFX**: Use Niagara to design dynamic particle effects.
    - **Animation**: Create complex animation sequences using the Animation Blueprint.
    - **Materials**: Develop and apply custom shaders.
    - **Sounds**: Design and integrate sound effects using Sound Cues and Ambient Sounds.

## Specialization Tracks
Students may choose to focus on the following Unreal Engine specialization tracks to achieve a distinction:

- **Sequencer**: Create a cinematic sequence of at least 30 seconds with 3 different camera cuts
- **Animation**: Create an animation sequence using the Animation Blueprint with smooth transitions and Blend Spaces.
- **Materials**: Develop a shader using Base Color, Normal, Metallic, and Roughness nodes.
- **Sounds**: Integrate sound effects using Sound Cues and Ambient Sounds.
- **VFX**: Design particle effects with Niagara.
- **AI**: (Optional) Implement basic AI for NPCs or environment interaction using Behaviour Trees and Blackboard.
- **Advanced Blueprints**: Develop complex game mechanics using things like line/sphere-tracing, splines, physics, enums, structs etc.
- **Level Design**: Design an engaging level layout for the minigame considering layout, flow, and spatial relationships.

## Visual and Audio Design
Students must adhere to the provided stylized low-poly asset pack for visual design to ensure consistency across all minigames. Any additional visual elements must align with the aesthetic style provided. For audio design, students are encouraged to design sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience.

## Deliverables
- **Minigame Prototype**: A fully functional and polished minigame that meets the course objectives should be committed to git repo before deadline ends.
